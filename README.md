# Hangman Game ðŸŽ®

A fun, interactive **Hangman Game** written in Python! Test your skills by guessing the country names before the hangman structure is fully drawn and your lives run out.

---

## How the Game Works
- You'll be provided with a word to guess, represented by underscores (`_`).
- Your task is to guess one letter at a time.
- **Correct guesses** reveal the positions of the guessed letter in the word.
- **Incorrect guesses** deduct one life, and the hangman structure progresses toward completion.
- You start with **7 lives**â€”use them wisely!

---

## Features
- **Random Country Selection**: A word is randomly chosen from the list of country names: `Canada`, `India`, `Italy`, `Australia`, `England`.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Receive live feedback for each guess and see the current state of the hangman structure.
- **Hints**: The category is provided as a clueâ€”guess the country name!
- **Win/Loss Conditions**: Guess the entire word to win, or lose if all lives are gone.
